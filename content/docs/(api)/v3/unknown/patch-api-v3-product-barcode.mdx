          This API allows to create or update a product (if the product already
          exists, its data is updated, otherwise it is created), or to analyze a
          test product (in which case no product is created or updated). To
          analyze a product, the "barcode" path component needs to contain the
          value "test" instead of a barcode.


          New API to send structured product data in a JSON format instead of in
          a flattened list of key / value pairs field as-in the current product
          add / edit API that relies on a multipart/form-data format.


          Important: this new Product WRITE API is under development. The
          initial deployment will support only packaging fields.


          This new API will be used in particular to send structured packaging
          data:
          https://openfoodfacts.github.io/openfoodfacts-server/dev/explain-packaging-data/


          The new API can then be gradually extended to support other product
          fields.

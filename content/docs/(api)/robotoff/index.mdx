# Robotoff API

This section contains the API documentation for Robotoff, Open Food Facts' machine learning service that provides predictions and allows for crowd-sourced annotations.

Robotoff provides a simple API allowing consumers to fetch predictions and annotate them. All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1` and the full URL is `https://robotoff.openfoodfacts.org/api/v1/{endpoint}`.

The service offers both production (`robotoff.openfoodfacts.org`) and preproduction (`robotoff.openfoodfacts.net`) servers.
